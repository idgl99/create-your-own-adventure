You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
joins up with a narrow north/south passage.

You're lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall that there's
a vending machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
